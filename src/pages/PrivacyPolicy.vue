                <h2 class="my-6 font-bold">Authorised agents</h2>
                <p class="my-2">You may appoint an authorized agent to exercise any of the rights above on your behalf, if the authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity registered. To appoint an authorized agent, you must also sign a written declaration giving the authorized agent permission to act on your behalf or you can appoint an agent via a power of attorney.</p>
                <p class="my-2">To verify that your authorized agent acts on your behalf, we will ask for this written permission from your agent or for the power of attorney. We will deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf. In case you provided your authorized agent with a written permission, we will require that you also verify your identity and we may also ask you to directly confirm with us that you gave the authorized agent permission to submit the request.</p>
                <h2>Response timing and format</h2>
                <p class="my-2">We will confirm the receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If we are required to verify your identity, we will contact you to describe our identity verification process. Please allow us up to forty-five (45) days to respond from the day we received your request. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and request an extension period (of up to an additional forty-five (45) days) in writing. We will send our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>
                <p class="my-2">If we cannot satisfy a request, we will notify you in writing explaining our decision and your options to make a complaint. For data portability requests, we will choose a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information to another entity without difficulty.</p>
                <p class="my-2">We will not charge a fee for processing or responding to your requests. However, we may charge a fee if we determine that your request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. In those cases, we will tell you why we made that determination and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
                <h2 class="my-6 font-bold">Personal information sales and sharing</h2>
                <p class="my-2">HKKO Investment Limited does not sell your personal information (as defined in the CCPA) in the conventional sense (i.e. for money).
