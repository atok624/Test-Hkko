                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    A Collateral-Based PPP requires investors to provide specific assets as collateral to participate in
                    the program. These assets serve as security for the investment and can include various forms of bank
                    instruments, such as Bank Guarantees (BG), Standby Letters of Credit (SBLC), or other financial
                    instruments.

      Key Features of Collateral-Based PPPs:
    </h2>

    <ul class="space-y-4 mb-8">
      <li class="flex gap-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Security:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          The collateral provides an added layer of protection for the investor. If the investment fails or the program doesn't deliver the expected returns, the investor's collateral can be used to recover the lost funds. This offers a level of risk mitigation.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex gap-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Lower Risk:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Because the program is backed by tangible assets, collateral-based PPPs tend to be less risky than their non-collateral-based counterparts. The presence of collateral helps to reassure investors that their capital is protected.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex gap-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Collateral Options:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Depending on the program, the collateral can be in various forms such as cash, gold, real estate, or even other securities. The choice of collateral can influence the risk profile and return potential of the investment.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex gap-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Higher Minimum Investment:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Since collateral is involved, investors may need to commit a larger minimum investment to participate in collateral-based PPPs. This can be a barrier for some investors but provides more security for those who are able to invest larger amounts.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex gap-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Liquidity Risk:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          If the collateralized asset is illiquid, it may be difficult to quickly convert it into cash.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li class="flex gap-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Valuation Risks:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Accurately valuing collateral can be challenging, especially in volatile markets.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How It Works:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-8">
      <li class="text-gray-700">
        The investor provides collateral (such as cash, gold, or other securities) to participate in the PPP. This collateral is held by a trusted intermediary or the platform itself.
      </li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">
        If the investor's position is at risk or the program experiences issues, the collateral can be liquidated to cover potential losses.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Benefits:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-8">
      <li class="text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-bold">Security:</span> Investors are generally protected against losses to some extent, as the collateral serves as a buffer.
      </li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-bold">Lower Risk:</span> The requirement for collateral often reduces the chance of fraud or total loss, providing more assurance for investors.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Risks:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
      <li class="text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-bold">Capital Lock-Up:</span> The investor's collateral is tied up for the duration of the program, limiting access to these funds for other investments.
      </li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">
        <span class="font-bold">Collateral Value Fluctuations:</span> If the collateral's value decreases (e.g., in the case of volatile assets like gold or stocks), investors might face losses despite having provided security.
      </li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    A non-collateral-based PPP allows investors to participate without requiring any collateral or

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    Both collateral and non-collateral-based private placement programs (PPPs) offer unique benefits and
                    risks. Collateral-based PPPs provide added security through collateral backing but require
                    significant upfront assets, making them more suitable for investors with substantial assets to
                    leverage.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Choosing between these two types of PPPs ultimately comes down to your investment goals, risk
                    tolerance, and the assets you have available. We recommend consulting with our investment advisors
                    to determine which program best suits your needs.
