            <h3 class="font-bold my-6">1. Receiving and Assessment: Precision from the Start</h3>
            <p class="my-6">Every refining journey begins with a careful assessment of the material received. HKKO
              GOLDsources precious metals globally, working with a variety of clients:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Mining Groups:</span>
                <span class="text-gray-600"> We partner with both new and established mining companies, helping them
                  bring raw gold from mines across diverse regions.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Global Markets: </span>
                <span class="text-gray-600"> Our client base includes international investors, central banks, and
                  individual clients who need secure refining for high-value assets.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Recycled Materials:</span>
                <span class="text-gray-600"> From old jewelry to industrial by-products, we refine recycled materials to
                  retrieve maximum value and create a purified, tradable product.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="my-6">Our team weighs, inspects, and performs an initial purity analysis to determine the best
              approach for refining each material. Whether handling raw gold, recycled jewelry, or non-London Good
              Delivery (LGD) investment bars, we assess each item’s unique properties to ensure an optimal outcome.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold my-6">2. Melting and Sampling: Quality Control at Every Step</h3>
            <p class="my-6">The refining process begins by melting the material in a high-temperature furnace, enabling
              us to homogenize the metal and eliminate impurities. We then conduct sampling at multiple stages to
              confirm purity and maintain quality control, ensuring that the refined product meets the exacting
              standards expected by clients and global markets alike. All incoming materials i.e. whether doréor
              recycled, are melted and sampled in our assay laboratory, where certified methods such as <span
                class="font-bold">fire assay,
                spectrometric, ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma), X-ray,</span> and <span class="font-bold"> chemical
                assays</span> ensure the highest accuracy.
            </p>
            <h3 class="font-bold my-6">Our Advanced Melting/Refining Techniques</h3>
            <p class="my-6">HKKO GOLD employs a suite of sophisticated refining techniques tailored to the type and
              purity level required for each material. These methods allow us to achieve purity levels of 99.5% to
              99.99%, making our refined gold suitable for a range of uses, from investment to industrial applications.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
              <li>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Aqua Regia Refining:</span>
                <span class="text-gray-600"> This technique involves a blend of hydrochloric and nitric acids, which
                  dissolves gold and other metals to leave behind pure gold. Aqua regia refining is particularly useful
                  for separating gold from metals such as silver and copper, ensuring a refined product that meets
                  international purity standards.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Electrolytic Refining: </span>
                <span class="text-gray-600"> Electrolysis uses an electric current to separate metals based on their
                  differing electrical charges, achieving extremely high levels of purity. This method is particularly
                  well-suited for gold intended for investment or central banking applications.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">Wet Chemical Parting:</span>
                <span class="text-gray-600"> For gold containing other precious metals, our wet chemical parting
                  technique effectively separates these metals, resulting in high-purity gold suitable for international
                  trade.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="my-6">These methods allow HKKO GOLD to consistently deliver results that match the specific
              requirements of our clients, whether they need gold for investment, banking, or commercial use.</p>
            <p class="my-6"><span> Example: </span> An electronics recycling company provides circuit boards containing
              trace amounts of gold. We use electrolytic refining to separate and purify this gold, returning it as
              high-purity bullion.</p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold my-6">3. Purification and Casting: Creating Market-Ready Gold Products</h3>
            <p class="my-6">Following the refining process, the purified gold is cast into various forms to suit client
              needs. Options include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">

            <h3 class="font-bold my-6">4. Rigorous Testing and Certification for Purity and Quality</h3>
            <p class="my-6">Before the gold is returned to clients, we perform rigorous testing to verify its purity and
              weight. Each refined product is accompanied by a <span class="font-bold">certificate of assay</span>,
              detailing the purity level and gold
              content, which ensures that our gold meets <span class="font-bold">LBMA (London Bullion Market
                Association)</span> and <span class="font-bold">COMEX</span> standards.
              This certification allows clients to trade or invest in their gold with full confidence in its
              authenticity and quality.
